### Dataset

We have used **IDRBT Cheque Image Dataset**

A cheque image dataset has been created at IDRBT using the 
Bank cheques with diverse texture and ink color. 

Total 112 cheque leaves from four diﬀerent banks in India 
are used as source document. In order to simulate the pen 
ink diﬀerence in cheque leaves, seven blue and seven black 
pens are used. To avoid biasness due to writing, 
nine diﬀerent volunteers have taken active participation 
to prepare the dataset, i.e., in writing the cheques. 

A total of 14 × 9=126 pen−volunteer combinations 
(fourteen pens and nine volunteers) are used for 
pen ink data generation. In practical scenario, 
similar color pens are used for addition of new words in 
source document. Each cheque is written by two volunteers 
using two diﬀerent pens (either blue or black). 

Hence, data set is created with 2 × 7C2 = 42 possible 
combinations of blue and black pens. 

All the cheque leaves are scanned in normal scanner at 
300 dpi resolution.
